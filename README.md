# Building a classifier system to save lives

Project to classify mushrooms between edible or poisonous.

Final project for the Python for Data Science course. I had to choose a dataset and apply any classification technique whether learned during the course or found in the internet, to classify mushrooms between edible or poisonous. I applied Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øves Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, XG Boost and Association Rules to make the classification. For the dataset, I used the one provided by the National Poison Data System (NPDS).
